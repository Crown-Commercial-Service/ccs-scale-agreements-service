# SCALE project Agreements Java microservice.

This is a mock implementation that conforms to v0.0.4 of the [Agreements Open API specification] (https://github.com/Crown-Commercial-Service/ccs-scale-api-definitions/blob/master/agreements/agreements-service.yaml).

It uses hard coded data - that is an approximation of the actual data (actual data is not yet available).
